<p><em>Secure search</em> is able to search and obtain records from encrypted database but lack efficiency. This article presents LEAF and its variant LEAF+, the first secure search protocol that uses three novels methods to decrease the time cost by $O(logn)$ comparing to state-of-art strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Fully homomorphic encryption(FHE) based secure search is an effective and safe communication for privacy-preserving data searching in the cloud. However, it suffers from high computation costs due to the expensive FHE operations (e.g. multiplication) required, especially in the searching step. This paper aims to discover a more efficient approach for the searching step.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> The searching step is about input an array composed of encrypted 1s and 0s, which indicate whether each record aligns with the user‚Äôs requirements, and output indexs of all 1s. This paper focuses on how to find the index of the first non-zero element, which is the key of this process. The LEAF‚Äôs main idea is to divide the input array into many intervals and apply the RS-OR operations(an efficient OR operation designed by Razborov-Smolenski) on intervals instead of the elements in order to reduce the number of RS-OR operations which is the main source of time-consuming multiplication. The author designs three steps to implement it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Localization:</strong> The goal of localization is to find the interval which contains the first non-zero elements. For every interval, they calculate RS-OR from the first element of the whole array to the last element of this interval. If the interval is before the first non-zero element, the result will be 0, otherwise, it is 1. Thus, the interval which contains the first non-zero elements will be the first 1. Hence, we get the target interval by a number of operations based on intervals, rather than the number of elements.</li>
<li><strong>Extraction:</strong> The purpose of extraction is to find the offset of the first non-zero element within the target interval by subsequent search operations on the interval. After figuring out which interval contains the target element, they apply AGHL (a secure search method with $O(nlogn)$ multiplications proposed by Akavia, Gentry, Halevi, and Leibovich) on target interval to get the offset of the first non-zero element.</li>
<li><em><strong>Reconstruction:</strong></em> The goal is to integrate the position information from the two steps above into one final output. After going through the steps mentioned above, they have obtained the position information of target intervals and the offset of the first non-zero element within the target interval. They combine them together to get the index of the first non-zero element.</li>
</ul>
<p>To control the growth of computational depth when <em>n</em> gets large, they further propose a variant named LEAF+, which applies bootstrapping to the elements in the target interval. Though boostrapping would bring extra multiplications, they prove that when <em>n</em> is large enough, the LEAF+ will be a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis and Evaluation:</strong> Though the method is more efficient than previous work, we need to consider the error probability brought by RS-OR. The author proves that the algorithm‚Äôs output is correct with a very high likelihood. To show this method doesn‚Äôt bring any extra calculation, this paper also illustrates that further steps (e.g. retrieval of matching items) would not increase the calculation depth. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the significant efficiency improvement the method brings, showing that LEAF could reduce the number of multiplications from ùëÇ (ùëõ log ùëõ) to ùëÇ (ùëõ) compared to the state-of-art algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In summary, this article introduces a search algorithm LEAF (and its variants LEAF+ ) for FHE-based secure search which is much more efficient than previous work. The author shows that this algorithm could reduce the number of multiplication from to while maintaining the computational depth.</p>
